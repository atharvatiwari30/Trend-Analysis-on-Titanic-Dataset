# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset in data science and machine learning. The primary goal is to analyze the data to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.

## Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and engineering useful features.
- Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables.
- Conduct bivariate and multivariate analysis to explore relationships between features and survival rates.
- Visualize data using various plots and charts to illustrate trends and correlations.
- Identify key factors that influenced passenger survival, such as gender, age, and passenger class.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers onboard the Titanic, including attributes such as:
- PassengerId
- Survived (target variable)
- Pclass (ticket class)
- Name, Sex, Age
- SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket number
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (port of embarkation)

The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for project development

## Key Insights
Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.

Passengers in higher classes (1st and 2nd) had better survival chances than those in 3rd class.

Younger passengers and children had better survival odds.

Fare paid and port of embarkation showed some correlation with survival rates.
